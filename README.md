# WebAPIcodeQuiz
Web APIs: Code Quiz

For this Code quiz project, I built an application which processed a timed code quiz.  
It runs in a browser and featured a dynamically updated HTML and CSS codes powered by robust JavaScript codes.  It has a clean, responsive and well-polished user interface.
This project is able to capture the highest scores of each tester in a linear sequence.
I submitted the urlâ€™s of a functional deployed application and the GitHub repository alongside a descriptive README file.
